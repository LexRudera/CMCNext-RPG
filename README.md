#CMC Next RPG

Yet to be named game project, based on the CMC Next concept and comic.  
[Original comic series](http://cmcnext.tumblr.com/ "CMC Next")

##Game idea
The game is a Super Mario RPG and Final Fantasy inspired turnbased RPG.  
The game is played out in the My Little Pony Friendship is Magic universe, featuring the same cast from the original comic series. As in the original show, the comic is based on, takes place in the land of Equestria, populated by sentient ponies. However the comic, and so the game as well, gives the world a different spin, by featuring a wide variety of malicious creatures, monsters and other entities, for our heroes to fight.

##Game technicalities
The game is programmed in C++ from scratch, on a custom made engine, on top of the [SFML Library](https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML "Simple Fast Multimedia Libaray"). Compiled with the latest version of the TDM MinGW pack.
